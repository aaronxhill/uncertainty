# visualizing uncertainty

From *The Grammar of Graphics*, Leland Wilkinson, Second Edition (2005), p. 451:  
> The word *uncertainty* derives from the Latin adjective *certus* (determined, fixed, settled), which itself is derived from the verb *cernere* (to discern or perceive, usually with the eyes). This etymology is relevant to our perspective on graphics and aesthetics because we encounter uncertainty when we are unable to perceive without doubt (*sine dubio*).

## Bertin's properties of the graphic system

The visual language I use as the basis for articulation of graphical elements and their placements in the planar system is an adaptation of the [system proposed by Jacques Bertin](https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Visual_Variables#Jaques_Bertin) in his 1967 book *[Semiology of Graphics](https://esripress.esri.com/display/index.cfm?fuseaction=display&websiteID=190)*. Bertin identifies six visual variables in the planar dimensions: size, value, texture, color, orientation, and shape. There are three types of signification--point, line, and area--that are the elementary figures of geography. Example variations on the visual variables by type of signification are illustrated in Bertin's book:
