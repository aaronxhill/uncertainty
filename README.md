# visualizing uncertainty

From *The Grammar of Graphics*, Leland Wilkinson, Second Edition (2005), p. 451:  
> The word *uncertainty* derives from the Latin adjective *certus* (determined, fixed, settled), which itself is derived from the verb *cernere* (to discern or perceive, usually with the eyes). This etymology is relevant to our perspective on graphics and aesthetics because we encounter uncertainty when we are unable to perceive without doubt (*sine dubio*).


## source code for uncertainty.io

This repository contains the source code for [www.uncertainty.io](https://www.uncertainty.io/). Contributions are encouraged and welcome, using [these guidelines](https://github.com/visualizedata/github-workflow). Node.js (deployed to AWS). 

## identity

The identity (branding image/logo/graphic) for [www.uncertainty.io](https://www.uncertainty.io/) titles the landing page and is also meant to convey the essence of the topic: the visualization of uncertainty in data. The identity treats the typography as data points and renders them with techniques (in D3js) to attempt to convey uncertainty. Contributions are encouraged and welcome, using [these guidelines](https://github.com/visualizedata/github-workflow). D3.js. [[source code](https://github.com/aaronxhill/uncertainty/tree/master/public/identity)]

## iterations in D3.js

A place for iterations on a [template of common graphs](https://www.uncertainty.io/iterations/) to try new ways of rendering uncertainty using D3.js. The template is still under development and no iterations exist yet. When the template is completed, contributions will be welcome. [[source code](https://github.com/aaronxhill/uncertainty/tree/master/public/iterations)]

## design research tool

A design research tool that complements a paper accepted at [2018 IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome) in the [VIS Arts Program](http://visap.net/), *Seeking New Ways to Visually Represent Uncertainty in Data: What We Can Learn from the Fine Arts* [[video preview](https://vimeo.com/289786519) | paper]. It is a queryable interface to references of more than 400 works of fine art that we feel have a unique ability to convey uncertainty using a range of approaches and techniques:

## Bertin's properties of the graphic system

The visual language I use as the basis for articulation of graphical elements and their placements in the planar system is an adaptation of the [system proposed by Jacques Bertin](https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Visual_Variables#Jaques_Bertin) in his 1967 book *[Semiology of Graphics](https://esripress.esri.com/display/index.cfm?fuseaction=display&websiteID=190)*. Bertin identifies six visual variables in the planar dimensions: size, value, texture, color, orientation, and shape. There are three types of signification--point, line, and area--that are the elementary figures of geography. Example variations on the visual variables by type of signification are illustrated in Bertin's book:
